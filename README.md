# mI-PIV
Mobile Instructional Particle Image Velocimetry (mI-PIV) is an educational Android application
that teaches users about fluid dynamics through real-time experiments and curricular modules.

The goal of this project is to promote and cultivate interest, active engagement, and 21st century
skill development within STEM areas through the development, implementation, and dissemination of
a low cost, mobile learning tool based on particle image velocimetry.
